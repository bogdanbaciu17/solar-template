The above is based on estimated installation costs, self-consumption and annual solar generation from south facing roof in Dublin City. Savings base on average electricity rate of 41c/kWh and microgeneration rate of 21c/kWh that is exported. All prices calculated at 0% since 1st May 2023.

*An average solar PV system can save over 50% per year on electricity, based on an average consumption of a house being 4200kWh/units. 8 x Solar PV panels or 3.2kWp will generate approx. 2700 units per year (50% of 4200,kWh/units = 2100kWh/units).
