##### Commercial Solar PV Panels Grants

New funding ranges from €2,700 to €162,600 to support an even wider range of businesses to switch to solar. This will typically support 20-30% of the investment cost, reducing payback to as little as 5 years. New Solar PV Scheme enhancements will boost business investment in renewable energy generation.
